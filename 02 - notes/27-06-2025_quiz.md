## 1. File/Dir Permissions & Ownership

### **a)**

**Question:**  
You find a file with permissions `-rw-r-xr--`. What is its octal representation?  
Give the exact command to set these permissions on a file called `confidential.txt`.

**My answer:**  
Its octal represantion is 654.  
`sudo chmod 654 confidentials.txt`

**Comentary & Evaluation:**

- Octal 654 is correct for `-rw-r-xr--`.
- Typo in filename: should be `confidential.txt` (minor).
- `sudo` is not always necessary, but fine if you need permission.
- Overall, accurate.
---
### **b)**

**Question:**  
Explain in 1–2 lines why using `chmod 777` on a shell script in `/usr/local/bin` is a security risk.

**My answer:**  
It represents a security risk because that enables read,write and execute for everone on the machine on a binary file which can contain malicious code.

**Comentary & Evaluation:**

- Clear on the risk: everyone can read, write, and execute.
- Could have added: anyone can replace the script with malicious code, especially dangerous if root executes it.
- Still solid.

### **c)**

**Question:**  
You want `bob` to own `/var/data/report.log` and ensure only his group `analysts` can edit it, but others must only be able to read.  
Write the full `chown` and `chmod` commands.

**My answer:**

```
sudo addgroup analysts
sudo adduser bob --disabled-password  
sudo adduser bob analysts 
id bob 
find /var/data sudo 
mkdir /var/data 
find /var/data 
sudo touch /var/data/report.log 
find /var/data/report.log 
ls -l /var/data 
sudo chown -R 664 bob:analysts /var/data/ ls -la /var/data
```

**Comentary & Evaluation:**

- `chown -R 664 bob:analysts` is invalid. `664` is a permission, not an owner.
    
- Correct sequence for one file:  
    `sudo chown bob:analysts /var/data/report.log`  
    `sudo chmod 664 /var/data/report.log`
    
- Creating the user/group and file is fine, but the critical commands were off.
- Partial credit.

## 2. Process Management

### **a)**

**Question:**  
You try to kill a process with `kill 1234` but it doesn't die. What’s the next command you try?  
Explain what it does, and the downside.

**My answer:**  
I would try `kill -9 1234`. To send a SIGKILL to that process to terminate it instantly. However this can lead to data corruption or loss since the process doesnt go trough a cleanup phase leaving temp, opened networks connections and other files used by the process alive. This can lead to the creation of a zombie process which means they consume no resources but still ocupy an entry. It can also can lead to unstability in the host due to a process not being terminated properly.

**Comentary & Evaluation:**

- Great, detailed answer. You clearly know SIGKILL’s consequences (no cleanup, risk of data loss, zombie procs, instability).
- Nothing major missed.

---

### **b)**

**Question:**  
Write a one-liner to list _all_ processes not owned by root or your current user, displaying the PID and username.

**My answer:**  
`ps -A -N -u 'root,mastermindhtb'`

**Comentary & Evaluation:**

- Not correct. `ps -A -N -u` is not valid syntax for this use.
    
- Correct would be:
    `ps -eo pid,user | awk '$2!="root" && $2!="yourusername"'`
    
- No points here.

---

### **c)**

**Question:**  
A user’s background job keeps respawning after being killed. Name two places to check for auto-respawn settings (be specific).

**My answer:**  
I would ether look for a file associated with system services or with cron jobs.

**Comentary & Evaluation:**

- You pointed out cron and system services, which is on the right track.
    
- More specific would be: `crontab -e`, `/etc/cron*`, `/etc/systemd/system/`, or even `/etc/inittab` (rare now).
    
- Partial credit for general direction.

## 3. Networking Tools

### **a)**

**Question:**  
Write a one-liner to show all TCP ports currently in `LISTEN` state, displaying process name and port.

**My answer:**  
`ss -tlp`

**Comentary & Evaluation:**

- This works and displays process names and ports (by service, not always port number).
    
- For numeric ports, add `n`: `ss -tlnp`.
    
- Minor flag detail, but acceptable.
    

---

### **b)**

**Question:**  
How do you find out which process is using UDP port 53?

**My answer:**  
`ss -up | grep '53'`

**Comentary & Evaluation:**

- This works, but `ss -ulpn | grep :53` or `lsof -i udp:53` are even more precise.
- Good enough for a practical answer.
---

### **c)**

**Question:**  
You want to view all open network connections, updating live every second. Which command do you use?  
Give the full command with flags.

**My answer:**  
`watch -n 1 ss -tuln`

**Comentary & Evaluation:**

- This is correct.
- Nice use of `watch` and flags.

---

## 4. Text Manipulation

### **a)**

**Question:**  
Extract the first and third fields (colon-separated) from `/etc/passwd` using `awk`.

**My answer:**  
`sudo awk -F ':' '{print $1, $3}' /etc/passwd`

**Comentary & Evaluation:**

- Perfect syntax.
- `sudo` is rarely needed, but not wrong.
    

---

### **b)**

**Question:**  
Replace all _uppercase_ "E" with lowercase "e" in a file called `NOTES.txt`, saving the result _in place_.

**My answer:**  
`sed -i 's/E/e/g' notes.txt`

**Commentary & Evaluation:**

- Command is correct for the replacement, but you wrote `notes.txt` (should match case: `NOTES.txt`).
    
- Minor detail, but the `sed` usage is right.
    

---

### **c)**

**Question:**  
Delete lines containing only whitespace from `messy.txt` using `sed`.

**My answer:**  
dont know how to. i search the solution.but im not going to put it here.

**Comentary & Evaluation:**

- No answer.
- Correct:
    `sed -i '/^[[:space:]]*$/d' messy.txt`

---

## 5. Shell Startup & Env Vars

### **a)**

**Question:**  
Briefly: When is `.bashrc` loaded? When is `.profile` loaded?

**My answer:**  
When a new non interactive shell is started or GUI or when sourced.  
when sourced or when starting a new interactive login shell.

**Comentary & Evaluation:**

- `.bashrc` is for _interactive non-login_ shells (e.g., new terminal tabs/windows).
- `.profile` is for _login shells_ (e.g., SSH, console login).
- Some imprecision, but partial credit.
    

---

### **b)**

**Question:**  
You added `export PATH=$PATH:/opt/tools` to `.bashrc` but it’s not applied after SSH login. Why? How do you fix it?

**My answer:**  
it still needs to be sourced by profile. since bashrc doesnt interact by default with login shells.

**Comentary & Evaluation:**

- Correct.
- The fix is to source `.bashrc` from `.profile` or put the export in `.profile` itself.

---

## 6. Bonus (for real-world mastery)

### **a)**

**Question:**  
Write a one-liner to list all _unique_ groups present in `/etc/group` (just the group names).

**My answer:**  
`cut -d ':' -f 1 /etc/group | sort | uniq`

**Comentary & Evaluation:**

- Correct and clean.

---

### **b)**

**Question:**  
Your script prints "Permission denied" when trying to write to `/tmp/locked.txt`.  
Show a command to troubleshoot the exact permissions and owner.

**My answer:**  
`ls -l /tmp` To check for parent folder and everything inside.

**Comentary & Evaluation:**

- Should check the file directly: `ls -l /tmp/locked.txt`.
- Also useful: `ls -ld /tmp` to see directory perms.
- Partial credit.

# Lessons Learned

- Don’t confuse `chown` (ownership) and `chmod` (permissions).
- Always check file _and_ directory permissions when troubleshooting access issues.
- `awk`, `sed`, and process-listing (`ps`, `grep`, `awk`) skills need daily practice—especially field filtering and complex matching.
- Be precise with shell startup file roles—know exactly when `.bashrc` and `.profile` are sourced.
- Don’t skip questions—writing even a wrong attempt cements learning.
- Details (flags, case, filenames) separate “functional” from “pro.”
    

---

# Next Steps

- Drill file/group permission changes, focus on combining `chown` and `chmod`.
- Practice “real-life” uses for `awk`, `sed`, and complex `ps` filtering.
- Test and memorize when each shell startup file runs.
- Force yourself to explain _why_ each command/option is needed.
- Never leave a blank—try, then check your work in a VM.
