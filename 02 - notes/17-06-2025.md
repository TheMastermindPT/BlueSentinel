### File Preparation

- **Copied** `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` **to** `exercise.txt`
    
    `cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config > exercise.txt`
    

---

### Exercise 1 – Show all lines **not containing** `#`

`grep -v '#' exercise.txt`

- Returns all lines that do **not** have the `#` character (including empty lines).

---

### Exercise 2 – Lines with a word **starting with** `Permit`

`grep -E '\bPermit\w*' exercise.txt`

- Finds any word starting with "Permit" (e.g., "PermitRootLogin").

---

### Exercise 3 – Lines with a word **ending with** `Authentication`

`grep -oE '\b\w*Authentication\b' exercise.txt`

- Successfully matches words like "PasswordAuthentication".

---

### Exercise 4 – Lines containing the word **Key**

`grep "Key" exercise.txt`

- Matches any line containing "Key" (not restricted to whole words).
- _Tip:_ For only the whole word "Key", use
    `grep -w 'Key' exercise.txt`
---

### Exercise 5 – Lines **beginning with** Password and **containing** yes

#### Initial attempts (no output):

`grep -E '^Password.*yes' exercise.txt grep -E '^\s*Password.*yes' exercise.txt`

- **Reason:** No uncommented line in your file starts with "Password" and contains "yes".

#### What worked (matches commented-out line):

`grep -E '^#Password.*yes' exercise.txt`

- Output:
    `#PasswordAuthentication yes`
- **Conclusion:**  
    Only the commented line matched. Remember: commented config lines are **inactive**.

---

### Exercise 6 – Lines that **end with** yes

`grep -E 'yes$' exercise.txt`

- Matches all lines ending in “yes”, commented or not.

>[!tip] Debugging & Lessons Learned
>- **Always check file contents** before writing complex regex.
>- **Comments (`#`) matter:** Config may set values only in comments.
>- **Use `grep -n` for line numbers: **
