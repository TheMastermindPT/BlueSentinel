### **User & Group Permissions**

#### **Create User With Home Directory**

- **Attempt:**  
    `sudo useradd 'pedro'`  
    → Created user, but **no home dir**.
    
- **Fix:**  
    `sudo useradd -m 'pedro'`  
    → Created `/home/pedro` as expected.
    
- **Note:**
    
    - `-m` or `--create-home` flag needed for home dir.
        
    - `userdel -r pedro` removes user & home dir.
        

#### **Lock User Account**

- **Attempt:**  
    `sudo usermod --lock pedro`
    
- **Result:**
    
    - Prevents password-based logins.
        
    - Does **not** kick off existing sessions.
        
    - Does **not** block SSH key-based logins.
        
- **Unlock:**  
    `sudo usermod --unlock pedro`
    
- **Learned:**
    
    - Use `--expiredate 1` or `/sbin/nologin` to fully disable.
        

#### **Execute Command as Another User**

- **Attempt:**  
    `su --command='ls -la' pedro`
    
- **Result:**
    
    - `--command` is the correct _long_ option for quizzes.
        
    - Real-world: `-c` works everywhere; `--command` only on some systems.
        
- **Learned:**
    
    - Know the difference between exam syntax and what’s actually available on your box.

### **Package Management**

#### **Git Clone Evil-WinRM**

- **Command:**  
    `git clone https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm.git ~/evil-winrm`
    
- **Verify:**
    
    - File exists, executable: `ls -la ~/evil-winrm/evil-winrm.rb`
        
    - Ran: `cd ~/evil-winrm && sudo ./evil-winrm.rb`
        
    - No errors.
        
- **Learned:**
    
    - Git clone is step one. Always check for further README install steps or missing dependencies.

### **Services & Process Management**

#### **Identify AppArmor Unit Managed by Snapd**

- **Attempt:**  
    `systemctl list-unit-files | grep apparmor`
    
- **Result:**
    
    - Only `apparmor.service` present, description: “Load AppArmor profiles”.
        
    - Quiz wanted `snapd.apparmor.service` (“Load AppArmor profiles managed internally by snapd”), which isn’t on this system.
        
- **Learned:**
    
    - If the unit isn’t there, the system probably doesn’t have Snapd or it’s not enabled.
        
    - Not all quiz questions match your actual lab environment.

### **Task Scheduling**

#### **Service Type for dconf.service**

- **Attempt:**  
    `systemctl list-units | grep dconf` → Not found.  
    `ps aux | grep dconf` → Found several session-level processes.
    
- **Quiz Answer:**
    
    - Type: `dbus` (**Correct, even though not obvious from systemctl.**)
        
- **How to Know:**
    
    - No systemd unit.
        
    - `/usr/libexec/dconf-service` is started per user via DBus (check `/usr/share/dbus-1/services/`).
        
- **Learned:**
    
    - If a user/session process isn’t in systemctl but is always running, check DBus service files.
        

---



    
- Session-level (user) services are often DBus-activated, not systemd-managed.
> [!TIP] **Reflections/Lessons**
> - Always check both real-world commands and quiz-intended answers—they’re not always the same.
> - If something isn’t working, check the system’s actual setup; don’t assume defaults.ents
