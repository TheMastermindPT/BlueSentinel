## Lessons Learned / Insights

- `.bashrc` is for interactive **non-login** shells (typical terminal windows, not SSH).
- `.profile` is sourced by **login** shells (SSH, tty login, graphical login); sets up the environment.
- System-wide env vars go in `/etc/profile` or `/etc/environment`.
- To cover both shell types, source `.bashrc` from `.profile`.
- `ss` is the modern alternative to `netstat`, can combine options for advanced network checks.
- `grep -i` = case-insensitive, `-w` = whole word match.
- `lsof` lists open files or network sockets/processes.
- `awk` extracts and formats fields (great for CSV/colon-separated files).
- `tr` is for single-character substitutions; use `sed` for more advanced edits (string/line changes).
- `>` overwrites, `>>` appends, both create files if missing.
- `ll` is usually an alias for `ls -la`, but only if defined (often in `.bashrc`).

>## Key Focus for Next Round
>- [ ] **Env Vars & Startup Files:** Study, drill, _own this_. No excuses.: [   ];
>- [ ] **Networking Tools:** Time to get comfy with `ss` and advanced `lsof` use.: [   ];
>- [ ] **Scripting & Output Redirection:** Slight brush-up on advanced usage.
>- [ ] **Archive note when all are checked as Mastered;**
