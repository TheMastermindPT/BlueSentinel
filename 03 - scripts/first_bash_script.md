> [!TIP] Remember:
> 
> - Remember to `chmod +x`to give executable perms to the file. Even if you are superuser the file cannot run without it.
>   
> - Conditions must be in `[[]]`.
>   
> - The condition needs to be properly spaced out or it will throw an error.
>   
> - `-z`option checks for empty string, which returns true.
>   
> - `read -p`is necessary to ask for a prompt on the console. This cannot be store in typical var=1 format.
>   
>  - `--ingroup` adds the user to an already existent group.
